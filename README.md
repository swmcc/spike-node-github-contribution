# spike-node-github-contributions

![APP](assets/app.png "APP")

## Description

I want to get a list of any commits or PR's from yesterday to be used for my
[changelog](https://changelog.swm.cc) app. At the time of writing I am hand
rolling the log every night. This is fine, it is given me a focus and I am 
loving the inertia it creates and it is getting me back into a regular cadence
of developing. However it isn't sustainable and in time I wont want to be bothered
doing it. So best to automate it.

I am refraining from writing the app in ruby or python. I want to learn new things
and also I want it integrated into the [changelog](https://github.com/swmcc/changelog.swm.cc) app 
so node makes sense.

Spiking this code out in a seperate repo is a bit controversial but it will allow me to be more 
liberal with commits. When I get it to where I want (whatever that is) then I will move it
to the changelog app.
